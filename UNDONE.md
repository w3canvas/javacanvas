1.  **DONE** ~~Set up the environment by installing `xvfb`~~
2.  **DONE** ~~Figure out why the tests are failing and fix them.~~
3.  **TODO** The `isPointInStroke()` test is still failing. There are also 10 other failing tests that might be related.
4.  **TODO** The root cause seems to be that nothing is being drawn on the canvas. The screenshots I have taken are all white.
5.  **TODO** I have tried to debug the issue by adding print statements and saving screenshots, but I have not been able to get any useful information. The print statements do not appear in the test output, and the screenshots are empty.
6.  **TODO** I am stuck and need help to figure out why the drawing operations are not working. I have pushed the current state of the code so that we can collaborate on this issue.
