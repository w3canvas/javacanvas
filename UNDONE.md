# JavaCanvas Project: Outstanding Work

This document outlines the current state of the JavaCanvas project, including missing features. It is intended to guide future development efforts.

## 1. Core API Implementations

The architectural refactoring aimed to create a backend-agnostic Core API. The following features are implemented:

*   **Gradients:** Implemented for both linear and radial gradients with a backend-agnostic approach.
*   **Patterns:** Implemented with a backend-agnostic approach.
*   **Text Metrics:** Implemented with a backend-agnostic approach.
*   **Image Data:** Implemented with a backend-agnostic approach.
*   **Web Workers (`Worker` and `OffscreenCanvas`):** The `TestWorker` test is now enabled and passes.

## 2. Missing Project Components

*   **Original JavaScript Source:** As noted in `AGENTS.md`, the original JavaScript files that contained the main application logic are missing from the repository. This includes the worker scripts mentioned above and potentially other critical library code. Without these, the full functionality of the Rhino-based components cannot be tested or restored.
