Successfully started process 'Gradle build daemon'
An attempt to start the daemon took 1.117 secs.
The client will now receive all logging from the daemon (pid: 41044). The daemon log file: C:\Users\Char'les\.gradle\daemon\8.12\daemon-41044.out.log
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':nativeCompile'.
> Determining GraalVM installation failed with message: 'gu.cmd' at 'C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.9.9-hotspot\bin\gu.cmd' tool wasn't found. This probably means that JDK at isn't a GraalVM distribution.
  
  Make sure to declare the GRAALVM_HOME environment variable or install GraalVM with native-image in a standard location recognized by Gradle Java toolchain support
