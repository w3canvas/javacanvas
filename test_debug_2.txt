Welcome to Gradle 8.12!

Here are the highlights of this release:
 - Enhanced error and warning reporting with the Problems API
 - File-system watching support on Alpine Linux
 - Build and test Swift 6 libraries and apps

For more details see https://docs.gradle.org/8.12/release-notes.html

To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.12/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon in the Gradle documentation.
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build
